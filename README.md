# nvidia_gpu_setup_on_tensorflow_and_torch

This is what I found and it works for me

Tips
1. pip install tensorflow-gpu no longer works gpu is already included in base tensorflow install
2. make sure you have the correct version for everything considering your device gpu
3. most tutorials out there uses conda if you wishes to be in a conda environment follow other tutorials but this tutorials works on everthing
4. I use this on VS Code venv of python 
5. my device is a laptop with a 3050 nvidia gpu
